            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Designed and simulated a functional printed circuit board (PCB) as part of a bootcamp project, demonstrating practical skills in circuit design, layout optimization, and digital fabrication preparation. The project highlighted proficiency in both electronics theory and applied PCB design using professional software tools.</p>

            <div class="project-details">
                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fully <b>designed schematics </b> with correct component placement and signal routing</li>
                    <li><b>Optimized PCB layout</b> to minimize noise, crosstalk, and signal interference</li>
                    <li>Prepared board for <b>fabrication-ready output, </b>including Gerber files</li>
                    <li>Simulated circuits to <b>verify functionality </b>before physical production</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
                <p>The PCB was created using <b>Altium Designer,</b> where schematics were drawn and <b>components were selected and placed</b> strategically to optimize performance. Signal traces were routed to minimize <b>electrical noise</b> and <b>interference,</b> and the board was <b>simulated</b> to verify proper functionality. <b>Design rules and constraints</b> were applied to ensure the PCB would be fabrication-ready, and <b>Gerber files</b> were generated for potential production. Iterative testing of the schematic and layout allowed for <b>error detection and correction</b> before finalizing the board.</p>

                
                
                <h3>Challenges & Solutions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Complex signal routing:</b> The motor initially lacked power to lift the curtain. This was solved by designing and 3D-printing custom gears to increase torque.Managing multiple connections in a compact layout was difficult. This was solved by careful <b>layer planning and trace optimization.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Component placement constraints:</b>Limited board space required strategic placement; iterative layout adjustments ensured proper fit and function.</li>
                    <li><b>Simulation accuracy:</b> Ensuring simulated behavior matched expected performance required repeated <b>verification and tweaking</b> of circuit parameters. </li>
                </ul>

                    <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>The final PCB design was fully <b>simulation-verified</b> and <b>ready for fabrication,</b> demonstrating strong proficiency <b>in circuit design, PCB layout, and electronic system integration.</b> The project showcased the ability to <b>apply theoretical knowledge in a practical, industry-standard design environment.</b></p>
